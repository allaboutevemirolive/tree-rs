## TODO

1. Implement `-gitignore`

2. Implement file `extension statistic` output

3. Implement print out file branch with only `specific extension`

4. Implement option to printout `branch only` (no statistic output)

5. DONE 

6. Convert output to ".md" file then to ".html"

    ```
    Output -> .md -> .html

    Probably we can directly convert output to ".html"

8. Do performance comparison with no cache, cold cache and hot cache.

## DONE

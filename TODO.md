## TODO

1. Implement `-gitignore`

2. Implement file `extension statistic` output

3. Implement print out file branch with only `specific extension`

4. Implement option to printout `branch only`

5. Implement option to avoid file that start with `.`

6. Convert output to ".md" file then to ".html"

    Output -> .md -> .html

    Probably we can directly convert output to ".html"

7. The design for this repo is still in early development. Major changes should be made to improve the 'walk' performance.

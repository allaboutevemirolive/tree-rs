This directory houses a script for creating benchmarks. There are two primary benchmarks to assess performance: one for a 'cold cache' scenario and another for a 'hot cache' scenario.

We will conduct experiments on both `treecraft` and `tree` to traverse Linux, Java projects, and so on.

Included Scripts:

1. Generate performance benchmarks for cold and hot cache.
2. Generate a changelog.
3. Generate a flame graph.
4. Automatically update README.md.

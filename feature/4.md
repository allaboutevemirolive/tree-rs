In the provided code structure, various structs are defined to represent different aspects of file and directory information, as well as configuration data. Here's the purpose of each of these structs:

1. **`struct _info`**:
   - Purpose: This struct is used to store detailed information about files and directories in the ASCII art tree view. It serves as a data structure to hold various attributes and metadata of each file or directory.
   - Fields:
     - `name`: The name of the file or directory.
     - `lnk`: A link to another file or directory.
     - `isdir`: Indicates whether it's a directory.
     - `issok`: Indicates if it's a symlink.
     - `isfifo`: Indicates if it's a FIFO (named pipe).
     - `isexe`: Indicates if it's an executable file.
     - `orphan`: Indicates if it's an orphan file.
     - `mode`: File permissions mode.
     - `lnkmode`: Link permissions mode.
     - `uid`: User ID of the owner.
     - `gid`: Group ID of the owner.
     - `size`: File size in bytes.
     - `atime`, `ctime`, `mtime`: Access, change, and modification times.
     - `dev`, `ldev`: Device and link device IDs.
     - `inode`, `linode`: Inode numbers.
     - `err`: Error message (if any).
     - `tag`: A tag associated with the file.
     - `comment`: Comments associated with the file.
     - `child`, `next`, `tchild`: Pointers to child, next, and temporary child nodes in the tree.

2. **`struct totals`**:
   - Purpose: This struct is used to keep track of totals, including the number of files, directories, and the total size of the listed items.

3. **`struct listingcalls`**:
   - Purpose: This struct defines function pointers for various callback functions related to listing items in the tree view. It provides a way to customize how items are listed and reported.
   - Fields:
     - `intro`, `outtro`: Functions for introducing and concluding the listing.
     - `printinfo`: Function for printing detailed information about a file or directory.
     - `printfile`: Function for printing a file within a directory.
     - `error`: Function for handling errors.
     - `newline`, `close`: Functions for handling line breaks and closure of items.
     - `report`: Function for reporting totals.

4. **`struct xtable`** and **`struct inotable`**:
   - Purpose: These structs are used in the context of hashing and indexing. They store information related to unique IDs (xid and inode) and associated names, respectively.

5. **`struct colortable`**, **`struct extensions`**, **`struct linedraw`**, and **`struct meta_ids`**:
   - Purpose: These structs are used for managing color, extension-based formatting, line drawing, and meta-IDs in the context of customizing the appearance of the tree view. They store data related to formatting and display options.

6. **`struct pattern`** and **`struct ignorefile`**:
   - Purpose: These structs are used in filtering files and directories based on patterns and ignore files. They store information about patterns to match and paths to ignore.

7. **`struct comment`** and **`struct infofile`**:
   - Purpose: These structs are used for managing comments and information files associated with files and directories. They store information about comments and their associated descriptions, as well as paths to information files.

Each struct serves a specific purpose within the ASCII art tree-view project, and they are used to store and manage various pieces of data and configuration settings.
